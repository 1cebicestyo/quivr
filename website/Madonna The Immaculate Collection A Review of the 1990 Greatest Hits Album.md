The album showcases Madonna's versatility and evolution as an artist, spanning from her pop-dance roots in songs like "Holiday" and "Lucky Star" to her more mature and controversial themes in songs like "Papa Don't Preach" and "Like a Prayer". The album also features some of her most iconic songs, such as "Material Girl", "Into the Groove", "Like a Virgin", and "Vogue". The album's title is a reference to Madonna's Catholic upbringing and her image as a sexual and religious icon.
 
The album was released on various formats, including CD, cassette, vinyl, and VHS. In 1990, a DVD version of the album was also released, featuring the music videos of all the songs on the album. The DVD was ripped by a user named n1c and uploaded as a torrent file on various websites. The DVD rip has a resolution of 480p and a file size of about 1.4 GB. The DVD rip is popular among Madonna fans who want to enjoy the visual aspect of the album.
 
Madonna The Immaculate Collection is a must-have for any Madonna fan or music lover who wants to experience the best of Madonna's career in the 1980s. The album is a testament to Madonna's talent, influence, and legacy as one of the most successful and influential artists of all time.
  
The album's remixes were done by Shep Pettibone, who had previously worked with Madonna on some of her singles and the soundtrack album I'm Breathless. Pettibone used QSound technology to create a spatial audio effect that enhanced the sound quality and depth of the songs. The remixes also added some new elements, such as additional vocals, instruments, and beats, to give the songs a fresh and modern feel.
 
The album's two new songs, "Justify My Love" and "Rescue Me", were co-written and co-produced by Madonna and Lenny Kravitz. "Justify My Love" is a sensual and provocative song that features spoken vocals by Madonna and a rap by Kravitz. The song's music video, directed by Jean-Baptiste Mondino, was banned by MTV for its explicit sexual content and imagery. The video became a media sensation and was released as a single on VHS. "Rescue Me" is a soulful and emotional ballad that showcases Madonna's vocal range and power. The song's music video, directed by Mark Romanek, features Madonna singing in front of various backgrounds and images.
 
The album received widespread acclaim from critics, who praised Madonna's musical diversity, artistic growth, and cultural impact. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave the album five stars out of five and called it "a flawless compilation". J.D. Considine from Rolling Stone gave the album four and a half stars out of five and wrote that "the real thrill of this set is hearing how Madonna makes pop history". Robert Christgau from The Village Voice gave the album an A grade and commented that "she's as good as she ever was--maybe better". The album also won several awards, such as the Billboard Music Award for Top Pop Album of the Year and the American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Album.
